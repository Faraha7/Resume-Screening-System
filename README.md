The Resume Screening System is a Django-based web application designed to automate and streamline the recruitment process. It allows employers to securely upload candidate resumes, which are then parsed using natural language processing to extract key information such as skills, experience, and education. The system evaluates each resume based on criteria like relevant experience, collaboration, and adaptability, assigning scores that help rank candidates effectively. The platform features both user and admin login capabilities, and includes an admin dashboard for managing submissions and reviewing results. Supporting files such as class diagrams, use case diagrams, and user flow diagrams are included for clear system documentation. The application is easy to set up, requiring basic Python and Django dependencies, and can be run locally for development or demonstration purposes. This project is intended for educational use and provides a solid foundation for further enhancements in resume analytics or AI-driven recruitment tools.
